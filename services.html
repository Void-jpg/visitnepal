        <h3 class="normal">Travel Insurance</h3>
        <p>
                A travel insurance policy that covers theft, loss and medical problems is best for travelling in Nepal. There are a wide variety of policies available, so check the small print carefully. Make sure are covered for adventure activities and high altitude.
                Also, understand that most medical treatment and facilities/hospitals must be paid for at the point of delivery of the patient. So it’s wise to choose a policy that pays doctors or hospitals directly rather than you having to pay on the spot and claim later.

        <p>
                The best way to witness the amazing grandeur of Nepal is definitely by walking but mountain biking provides a great new alternative. Although not necessarily new, since mountain biking in Nepal persisted long time ago; the trend of hiring a bike from different shops, cycling with your buddies to a new location once in a while and participating in an event has just been soaring up
